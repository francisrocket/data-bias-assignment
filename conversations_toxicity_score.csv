10,  So on the tenth anniversary of 911 New York Times columnist Paul Krugman delivered the odious piece of dribble ever on the attack  well at least since the last time he wrote about it The headline is quote The Years of Shame end quote And no its not directed at radical Islam Instead he targets America and the quote fake heroes Krugman claims that the atrocity has been hijacked The sick word given that hes not actually talking about the real hijackers who killed some 3000 Americans No hes referring to people like George Bush and Rudy Giuliani who he thinks capitalized on the horrible crimes But the worst part at the end of this column the creep writes Im not going to allow comments on the post for obvious reasons That obvious reason hes a coward I mean why else would you ban responses Hes like a 10yearold boy crankcalling all of us only to hang up even before he hears a response hearing his shame for his own wickedness Now I watch the memorial services and I feel sorrow for the families whose grief never really ends But since Im lousy at emotional reflection I usually avoid it But at least I can summarize what many feel today in nine words go to hell Paul Krugman you bearded bitter buffoon,0.3561489
